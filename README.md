# My 'piscine' at 42 Urduliz
In May 2021 I took part in the very first 'piscine' organized at 42 Urduliz, in Bilbao.

In this repository you can find all the projects I managed to complete in the 26 days we were given. 
The first two projects were on shell scripting, while the others on C programming.
