# My 'piscine' at 42 Urduliz

In May 2021 I took part in the very first 'piscine' organized at 42 Urduliz, in Bilbao.

In this repository you can find all the projects I managed to complete in the 26 days we were given.

## WARNING IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TAKING PART IN A PISCINE!!
**I strongly recommend that you don't look at the solutions provided in this repo. It won't help you in any way. The whole idea behind the 'piscine' is that you try your best and asks your classmates for help. Also, it would spoil the surprise and affect your experience. **

The first two projects were on shell scripting, while the others on C programming.

Rushes were 2-day projects assigned on weekends. Bsq is a final 3-day projects.
